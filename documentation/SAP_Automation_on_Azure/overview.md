# Overview <!-- omit in toc -->


<!-- TODO -->

The **SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework** is a collection of processes and a flexible workflow.




The templates are split into:
- **Terraform modules**
which deploy the infrastructure components (such as VMs, network, storage) in Azure.
- **Ansible playbooks**
which run different roles to configure and VMs and install SAP HANA and required applications on the already deployed infrastructure.
